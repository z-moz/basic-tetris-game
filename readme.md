Project 1: Tetris!

what is the project     
what does it do  
player manual (mostly for myself to clarify the rules the game needs to follow) 
most challenging points I foresee

every time you work on it write like a mini-journal 
(wireframes, 
code screenshots, 
challenges)      
screenshots of the canvas at various stages of the project 
gif demos  

challenge 1, rendering of blocks falling: 
    continuous movement or cell to cell? 
    cell to cell: means it would be a grid of cells and that would make  problems like the bottom full row disappearing or the blocks landing on top of the other blocks a lot easier to do. 
    continuous movement: looks a lot more impressive. 
    => cell to cell

challenge 2, rotation of blocks:
    various rotation systems, going with the Super Rotation System:

challenge 3, grid of cells, cell id's 0-239 or columns+rows?
    grid: 10 columns * 24 rows
